Create a modern Apple Music Analytics Dashboard UI.

The dashboard must contain 5 main sections corresponding to 5 business intelligence queries:

1) Royalties Report (Last 30 Days)
   - Bar chart showing total seconds played per artist.
   - Subtitle: "Total streaming time per artist (seconds)."

2) Top 10 Songs in Guatemala
   - Table or bar chart of the 10 most played songs in the last 7 days.
   - Columns: Position, Song Title, Artist, Streams.

3) Zombie Users (Premium Users without Activity)
   - Table listing premium users with no activity in the last 30 days.
   - Columns: Username, Email, Country, Subscription.

4) Reggaeton Demographics
   - Donut chart or bar chart showing distribution by age ranges:
     (15-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50)
   - Subtitle: "Demographic distribution of users who listen to Reggaeton."

5) Heavy Users — Bad Bunny
   - Table showing top 5 users who listened to the most distinct Bad Bunny songs.
   - Columns: Username, Email, Distinct Songs.

General UI Requirements:
- Use Apple Music style: red, white, black gradients.
- Clean, minimalistic UI similar to Apple Analytics dashboards.
- Include sidebar navigation with icons for each section.
- Include top navigation with title: "Apple Music Analytics Dashboard".
- Each section should appear as a card or module with titles and subtitles.
- Make it responsive and visually appealing for presentation.

Do NOT generate backend code. Only generate the front-end layout in clean JSX/HTML with Tailwind or modern UI styling.
